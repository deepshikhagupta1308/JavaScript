##Object Notes :

1. What are JS Objects ?
- It is a data structure to keep data in a key value format.

Example : 


    const object = {
        name:"deepshikha"
    }

    *key(name) must be string type only
    *value(deepshikha) can be any data type


2. How to create an object in JS?
- Javascript Objects can be created in three ways.

1.Using Object lterals or curly braces.
Example : const obj1 = {}

2.Using JS Object Constructor method.
Example: const obj2 = new Object();

3.Using Object create method.
Example: const obj3 = Object.create();

3.Difference Between new and literals?
- Object created with literals are singleton.
- This means change in one object it affects all of it's reference.

Example: 

   const employee = {
       id:123,
       name:"Arun Gupta"
   }

   const newEmployee = employee;
   console.log('employee name:' , employee.name);
   console.log('newEmployee name:' , newEmployee.name);

   newEmployee.name = "Kapil Sharma";

   console.log('employee name:' , employee.name);
   console.log('newEmployee name:' , newEmployee.name);

- Object defined with a new lets you have multiple instances of that object. 
- This means change made to one instance, will not affect other instances.

Example: 

  const employee = function() {
      this.name = "Deepshikha";
  }

  const employee = new Emp;

  console.log('employee name:',employee.name);
  console.log('Emp name:',Emp.name);

  Emp.name = "Sanskrati";

  console.log('employee name',employee.name);
  console.log('Emp name:',Emp.name);
